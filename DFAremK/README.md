**This Program is for generating a DFA for getting remainder for a binary string when divided by a number k**
Using simple Matrix for saving state table and dotty for displaying the DFA graphically.

## Generate a DFA

Choose option 1
Generation Logic : 
if p is the current state then the next state is :
for 0 : 2p % k
for 1 : 2p+1 % k
---

## Display DFA

Choose option 2
Requires Graphviz to be installed in a linux environment.

## Evaluation of a string of binary numbers

Choose option 3
Traces the State progress of the dfa for the given input string
