**This Program is for Simulating A MultiStack Machine also Known as MultiStack PDA, Currently Implemented Turing Machine only**
	- Using simple Matrix for saving rules and dotty for displaying the Machine graphically.

## Input File

	- Choose option 1
	an Example Input file is given in input.txt
	Input File structure/format :
	- Line number
	- 1 : Number of States
	- 2 : Number of Rules
	- 3 : Final state/Accepting state
	- 4 : Machine Tape Symbols (including input symbols)
	- 5 to end of file : Rules defined as 5 tuples : startState,nextState,inputSymbol,Direction,replacementSymbol
---

## Console Input for Rules

	- Choose option 2
	- Follow On Screen Instructions.
---

## Evaluation of a string of Characters

	- Please try to give valid input string, otherwise its not an error, but string does'nt get accepted
	- Traces the State progress of the Machine for the given input string
